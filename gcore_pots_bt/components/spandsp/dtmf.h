/*! \page dtmf_rx_page DTMF receiver
\section dtmf_rx_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The DTMF receiver detects the standard DTMF digits. It is compliant with
ITU-T Q.23, ITU-T Q.24, and the local DTMF specifications of most administrations.
Its passes the test suites. It also scores *very* well on the standard
talk-off tests. 

The current design uses floating point extensively. It is not tolerant of DC.
It is expected that a DC restore stage will be placed before the DTMF detector.
Unless the dial tone filter is switched on, the detector has poor tolerance
of dial tone. Whether this matter depends on your application. If you are using
the detector in an IVR application you will need proper echo cancellation to
get good performance in the presence of speech prompts, so dial tone will not
exist. If you do need good dial tone tolerance, a dial tone filter can be
enabled in the detector.

\section dtmf_rx_page_sec_2 How does it work?
Like most other DSP based DTMF detector's, this one uses the Goertzel algorithm
to look for the DTMF tones. What makes each detector design different is just how
that algorithm is used.

Basic DTMF specs:
    - Minimum tone on = 40ms
    - Minimum tone off = 50ms
    - Maximum digit rate = 10 per second
    - Normal twist <= 8dB accepted
    - Reverse twist <= 4dB accepted
    - S/N >= 15dB will detect OK
    - Attenuation <= 26dB will detect OK
    - Frequency tolerance +- 1.5% will detect, +-3.5% will reject
